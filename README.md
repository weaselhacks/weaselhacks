- 👋 Hi, I’m @weaselhacks
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things having come from a network and network security background.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots of things, badly, Python, API usage, Postman, Git, AWS, Azure, GCP as infrastructure and security capabilities. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on....not sure...I'm struggling with time and do other things in the evenings not coding...However I am interested to hear about peoples efforts and sometimes even know stuff myself.
